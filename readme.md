## Description

The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) and the Michigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences (MSSISS) have partnered with the 
City of Detroit to help solve one of the most pressing problems facing Detroit - blight. Every year, Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to 
residents that fail to maintain their property (called blight violations), and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight 
fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?
